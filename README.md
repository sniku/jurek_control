jurek_control
=============

Raspberry pi driver for Tortoise/terrarium automation 

This is a 0.1a version of my project to automate the tortoise terrarium at home.

At the moment there is only one water-pump connected to the Pi that sprinkles water every hour to sustain humidity.

I plan to add an autmatic feeder and "weather station" for monitoring humidity and temperature.

    Usage:
      jurek_control pump (--turn-on <seconds> | --turn-off)
      jurek_control (-h | --help)
      jurek_control (--version)
